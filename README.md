# Operate | Website

Official Operate website and documentation, generated by VuePress.

## About Operate

Operate is a toolset to help developers build applications, games and services on top of Bitcoin (SV). It lets you write functions, called "Ops", and enables transactions to become small but powerful programs, capable of delivering new classes of services layered over Bitcoin.

More infomation:

* [Project website](https://www.operatebsv.org)

## Developing

To run the website locally:

* Install dependencies with `yarn install`
* Start Vuepress with `yarn run dev`
* Visit [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) from your browser

Some components rely on a locally running instance of [Operate | API](https://github.com/operate-bsv/op_api), although it is not necessary to run the API when working with most of the static pages and documentation.
