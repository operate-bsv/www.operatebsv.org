# Operate | Website

Operate is an extensible Bitcoin meta programming protocol. It offers a way of running programs encapsulated in Bitcoin (SV) transactions that can be be used to process data, perform calculations and operations, and return any computable value.

**Operate | Website** is the project website and documentation, generated by VuePress.

More infomation:

* [Project website](https://www.operatebsv.org/)

## Developing

To run the website locally:

* Install dependencies with `yarn install`
* Start Vuepress with `yarn run dev`
* Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) from your browser

A couple of components rely on a locally running instance of [Operate | API](https://github.com/operate-bsv/op_api), although this is not necessary for working with the static pages and documentation.
