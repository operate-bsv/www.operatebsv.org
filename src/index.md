**Operate** is a toolset to help developers build applications, games and services on top of Bitcoin (SV). Operate lets you create and run on-chain functions, called "Ops", enabling transactions that can implement application logic and securely integrate with other services and platforms.
:::

::: slot features
* ### On-chain functions
  Create functions that can process data, perform calculations and operations, and initiate off-chain actions.

* ### Turing complete Bitcoin
  Write programs that return any computable value. Even write programs that write other programs!

* ### Extensible API
  Create extensions to integrate Operate with your own application and other microservices.

* ### Decentralised eco-system
  A decentralised, permissionless repository of functions that anyone can use and contribute to.

* ### Content addressable
  One reference per unique function. A universal naming mechanism where no authority owns a namespace.

* ### Familiar conventions
  Operate's design is based on already familiar conventions and patterns established with Bitcom.

* ### Do Bitcoin your way
  You chose how Operate connects to Bitcoin, whether through Planaria, API gateways or directly to your own Bitcoin node.
