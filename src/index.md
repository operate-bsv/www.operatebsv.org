***Operate** is an extensible Bitcoin meta programming protocol.* It offers a way of constructing Turing Complete programs encapsulated in Bitcoin (SV) transactions that can be be used to process data, perform calculations and operations, and return any computable value.
:::

::: slot features
* ### Turing complete Bitcoin
  Write programs that return any computable value. Even write programs that write other programs!

* ### Extensible VM
  Create extensions to integrate Operate in any way with your own applications and hardware.

* ### Decentralised eco-system
  Operate is a decentralised, permissionless repository of functions that anyone can use and contribute to.

* ### Content addressable
  One reference per unique function. A universal naming mechanism where no authority owns a namespace.

* ### Familiar conventions
  Operate's design is based on already familiar conventions and patterns established with Bitcom.

* ### Connect to Bitcoin your way
  Whether through Planaria, other API endpoints or directly to your Bitcoin node, you chose how Operate connects to Bitcoin.
