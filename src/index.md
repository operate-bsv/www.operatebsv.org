**Operate** is a toolset to help developers build applications, games and services on top of Bitcoin (SV). It lets you write functions, called "Ops", and enables transactions to become small but powerful programs, capable of delivering new classes of services layered over Bitcoin.
:::

::: slot features
* ### On-chain functions
  Create functions that can process data, perform calculations and operations, and initiate off-chain actions.

* ### Turing complete Bitcoin
  Write programs that return any computable value. Even write programs that write other programs!

* ### Smart, extensible, protocols
  Design `OP_RETURN` protocols that can implement application logic and integrate with other services and platforms.

* ### Flexible integration options
  Create extensions to integrate Operate with your own application and other microservices.

* ### Decentralised ecosystem
  A decentralised, permissionless repository of functions that anyone can use and contribute to.

* ### Content addressable
  One reference per unique function. A universal naming mechanism where no authority owns a namespace.

* ### Familiar conventions
  Operate's design is based on already familiar conventions and patterns established with Bitcom.

* ### Do Bitcoin your way
  You chose how Operate connects to Bitcoin, whether through Planaria, API gateways or directly to your own Bitcoin node.
