**Operate** is a toolset to help developers build applications, games and products on top of Bitcoin. Operate enables you to write functions, called Ops, and call those functions from programs encapsulated in Bitcoin transactions. Extend Bitcoin's capabilities to the limits of your imagination.
:::

::: slot features
* ### On-chain functions
  Create functions that can process data, perform calculations and operations, and initiate off-chain actions.

* ### Turing complete Bitcoin
  Write programs that return any computable value. Even write programs that write other programs!

* ### Extensible API
  Create extensions to integrate Operate with your own applications and systems in any way.

* ### Decentralised eco-system
  A decentralised, permissionless repository of functions that anyone can use and contribute to.

* ### Content addressable
  One reference per unique function. A universal naming mechanism where no authority owns a namespace.

* ### Familiar conventions
  Operate's design is based on already familiar conventions and patterns established with Bitcom.

* ### Do Bitcoin your way
  Whether through Planaria, other API endpoints or directly to your Bitcoin node, you chose how Operate connects to Bitcoin.
